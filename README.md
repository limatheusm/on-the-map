# On the map!

## Project Overview
Students will create an application containing a map that displays information published by other students. This map will contain markers that show where students reported being. By touching the marker, users can see a URL that points to something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by publishing a string that can be geocoded to a location in addition to a URL.
